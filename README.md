# Mac-Address-Changer
This script will allow the user to change their Mac Address. This is done by using the python library `subprocess` that allows you to run shell scripts in your python code. Once the script is ran, it will prompt the user to put in the interface they want to change and then prompt them to input the new Mac Address they want for this interface. Once they input the requested information the script will then print out that the Mac Address has been changed and then run `ifconfig` to show the interface configurations. Below is an example of me changing my Mac Address in my Kali Linux VM:
